Conversational vs. Traditional Search Evaluation â€“ Research Prototype

This project is a research prototype developed to evaluate user satisfaction and effectiveness in conversational (AI-based) versus traditional (keyword-based) search engines. It allows users to perform side-by-side searches and compare the experience between LINKS and CONVERSATIONS, including the quality of answers and overall satisfaction with each method.

The prototype uses OpenAI's API to power to represent results.

Purpose:

1)  Explore the qualitative and quantitative differences in user experience.
  
2)  Measure perceived relevance, accuracy, and usability.
  
3)  Support usability testing, A/B testing, or academic research in HCI, NLP, or information retrieval.

Technologies: 

Frontend: React.js + Tailwind CSS, Google tag management

Backend (optional): Node.js / Express, Firebas

AI Engine: OpenAI GPT-4 (via OpenAI API)


Deployment (optional): Vercel / Netlify
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
